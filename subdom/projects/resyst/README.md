# resyst

An attempt to create simple object PHP content management system for one
publisher, who doesn't want any unnecessary bloat like Wordpress and alike.

Steps to make the system work:

1/ create database called the same as defined in DSN of configuration.data.php
2/ run <repo_root>/scripts/build_resyst_db script
3/ DB should be built by now, so after setting up the target host, system filled using sample data should be accessible and functioning
