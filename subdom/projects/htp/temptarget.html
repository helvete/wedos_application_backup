 "But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked<br>
"Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat,<br> "We're all mad here. I'm mad, 
you're mad."<br>
"How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice<br>
"You must be," said the cat "or you wouldn't have come here." <br><br>

<p>[2002 11 27] Ok now. After this little break, I've finally decided
to maybe update smth here. A new dir was just created for various stuff
that could be downloaded, follow <a href="http://kristi.erdves.lt/stuff/">this link</a>. I must really apologize for all the mess over here, will spend some time on getting rid of it someday. Have phun ;]

</p><p>[2002 07 28] Just a note. I was doing the translation of the 1st
chapter of "Neuromancer" by William Gibson. I finished it ages ago, but
hadn't put it online. So you can already get to it at the Thoughts
section. Sorry for the MS Word format :E. Will convert it into PDF in
near time (another promice, heh).
</p><p>[2002 07 27] Pew! Being currently online, I decided to drop a
couple of lines into here - for the ones who might be looking for me :]
As you might have noticed, I've been offline for a while now. Hope to
have a normal access to the net soonish, and meanwhile please accept my
apologises for all the unfinished works -- I also *promise* to get back
to the projects which I abandoned after losing this darn access. And
oh, if any of you folks have recently sent me mail and didn't get any
reply, please do resend it. I happen to have just deleted approxymately
2 thousand of them from the server -- an unfortunate accident, huh (or
maybe a hopeless brain, call it whatever ;] ). Sorry and thanks for
devoting time to do it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the rest, I'm on to slightly update this site
now. More significant updates are to come a little later, and as usual
I'm looking forwards to your comments, requests and similar stuff.
</p><p>[2002 03 06] I recently found out there's an increasing number
of tech articles that catch my attention so I decided to add a separate
dir for them here. Look up the <a href="http://kristi.erdves.lt/pc.html">CPT Stuff</a> section.

</p><p>[2002 03 01] The page is still completely incomplete, 'tho most
of the things are at least going the right way..:] I'd like to point
that writing this site, I kept in mind *nix browsers, and it's tested
on almost everything except M$ IE. So to say, use it at your own risk
