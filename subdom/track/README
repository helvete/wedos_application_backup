PHP Ticket README

-- Short Intro
PHP Ticket is in short a ticketing system written in PHP, backed up by a MySQL database. 
Its purpose is to provide helpdesks/staffs with an easy "todo" application for keeping 
track of what needs to be done. The interface is kept fairly simple and easy to use.

Having frequented the OpenTicket system used at KTHNOC (Network Operations
Center at Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden) which is the node at
which SUNET, NORDUNET and national ISPs connect (PoP), I felt a need to
list my tasks and troubles at work (being a sysadmin) to keep track of what needs
to be done and to give other people a chance to read and post tickets.

-- Features
+ IMAP support for importing tickets from external email accounts
+ automated installation through install.php
+ user management and login functions using sessions
+ all configuration in interface, no database knowledge needed
+ ability to send notifies by email upon ticket changes
+ printable tickets
+ search capabilities
+ all HTML is using CSS


-- Requirements
+ A PHP capable webserver (preferably apache: http://www.apache.org)
+ PHP 4.1 or higher
+ MySQL, 3.x probably works, but 3.23.*/4 is preferred
+ Clients must accept cookies for login info and handle CSS
+ I'm running phpticket on a 486 66mhz/64mb on linux 2.2.x and it's fast


-- Installation/Upgrading
+ Move all files to a directory readable by the webserver.
+ Make sure the webserver user has write permissions on 'mysql.inc.php',
  ("chmod mysql.inc.php 666" probably does it) or the installation will fail. 
+ Point your browser to 'install.php' and follow the instructions
+ Move/delete/change permissions on 'install.php' so it can't be run after installation
+ Change permissions on 'mysql.inc.php' to 644 ("chmod mysql.inc.php 644")
+ Login as admin/admin and change administrator password for security
+ Edit any settings to your liking


-- About
This software is written by Daniel Netz (netz at home dot se) using PHP, Apache
and MySQL 3.x/4.x on linux. Bug reports and feature requests  are always welcome
and preferably discussed in the forum (see link below). 
This software is licensed under the GNU GPL license (see COPYING) and may be used and
distributed in any way it may suit you as long as it's according to GPL.
I've kept the interface simple and subtle for a reason, speed and ease of use. 


-- IMAP support
Warning: the IMAP support is EXPERIMENTAL and must be used with precaution.
Please do NOT use this on a production database/server without proper testing.
The IMAP support enables users to import tickets from external email accounts,
protocols supported are IMAP4, POP3, NNTP, optionally over SSL. To enable IMAP
support, set imap_support to 1 and set the other imap_* settings to an appropriate
value. The imap_type setting defines the protocol used, these are the supported
values:

IMAP4:		1
POP3:		2
IMAP4_SSL:	3
POP3_SSL:	4

When imap_support is enabled, administrators can use the "Import IMAP" link in
the configuration screen to import IMAP emails into the database. This behavior
is subject of change in later versions.


-- Security
Security is an important issue in phpticket, although I don't have either knowledge
nor the time to make sure phpticket is safe in all ways, so use it wisely. The most
common issue is SQL Injections, i.e. strings directly inserted into SQL queries that
can be altered to do simply anything possible with SQL. However, as far as I can see,
for a malicious user to insert SQL code he/she has to be able to log in and should
therefor have some kind of trust.
